# Development Notes

## Building and Testing the Extension

### Get Started

```console
git clone "https://github.com/rnwst/easy-languages-dict.git"
cd easy-languages-dict
npm install
npm start
```


### Build Script `build.js`

The extension can be built using the build script `build.js`, which is executed by the various `npm` commands in `package.json`. For Chromium, manifest version 3 (MV3) is used, and for Firefox (both desktop and Android versions) MV2 is used. The build script uses [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) for bundling. It also has a 'watch' mode. In this mode, the script launches a browser, watches for changes to the source files, and reloads the updated extension in the browser. This functionality is provided by [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext).


### Desktop Browser Profiles

When in 'watch' mode, `build.js` launches a browser instance using the browser profile in `browser-profiles/{browser}`. This profile is not version-controlled, and changes to it persist across instances of `npm start`. It is recommended to install a YouTube ad-blocking extension such as uBlock Origin in the profile to improve the developer experience.


### On Android

Firefox for Android is the only major browser to support extensions on Android, however, due to [this Firefox for Android bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1872508), **the extension doesn't currently work on Firefox for Android**.

If you would nonetheless like to test the extension on Firefox for Android, first edit `manifest.json` and add the following entry under `browser_specific_settings`:
```json
    "gecko_android": {
      "strict_min_version": "113.0"
    }
```
Then, make sure that `adb` is installed on the computer. On Arch Linux, this is provided by the [android-tools](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/android-tools/) package. On the Android device, install [Firefox Nightly for Developers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix). Open the app, go to *Settings* â†’ *Advanced*, and enable *Remote debugging via USB*. Then run the build script: `npm run start-firefox-android`. Open a Firefox instance on the computer, and navigate to `about:debugging`. Select *Enable USB Devices*. The device should appear in the menu on the left and can be connected to. Open tabs as well as the extension's background page can then be inspected.

[Kiwi](https://github.com/kiwibrowser/src) is another browser that supports browser extensions on Android, but I don't know if the developers can be trusted to follow good security practices, and therefore it is unlikely that this extension will ever officially support Kiwi or recommend its usage.


## Debugging the Extension

See these [notes on extension debugging](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/debugging/).


## Notes on Cross-Browser-Compatibility

### Manifest v2 vs v3

Chrome no longer accepts new extensions using manifest v2 (MV2) at the Chrome Web Store, and therefore MV3 must be used. However, I don't consider Firefox's version of MV3 useable yet. In Firefox's version of MV3, all permissions are optional, and the user is not automatically prompted for those permissions - thus, the extension doesn't work due to a lack of required permissions, and the user is left wondering why. In addition, MV3 is not (yet) supported on Firefox for Android. Therefore, the `manifest.json` in this directory is (mostly) Chromium-compatible (apart from the `browser_specific_settings` key) and uses MV3, and the build script `build.js` converts it to MV2 for the Firefox build during the build process.


### Browser Extension APIs

Browser APIs used in extensions differ for every browser. See [WebExtension API support](https://browser.kagi.com/WebExtensions-API-Support.html) for comprehensive documentation. The APIs in Chromium are available on the `chrome` object and not the `browser` object (which does not exist in Chrome), however Firefox supports usage of the `chrome` object for compatibility reasons (see [here](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill/issues/329#issuecomment-1188822881) for more information), and therefore it is possible to have a browser-agnostic codebase by using the `chrome` object.
